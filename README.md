An Internet of Things (IoT) device to determine whether an observed area is occupied. Utilizes Python and Wireshark to 
preform a timed packet collection targeting MAC address and Rx power. Then, post-processes and analyzes the data using an 
optimized K-Means algorithm to establish room occupancy. Developed for a Raspberry Pi 3.

Coordinated a group of 3 classmates to partition tasks and complete the project ahead of the semester deadline.
Implemented features such as General Descriptor Table (GDT), Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), Paging (Virtual Memory), 
Program Execution, Concurrent Processes, Task Scheduling, Drivers (keyboard, RTC, PIT, terminal).
